# BreastCancer
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. 
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust system for the detection of breast cancer using mammogram images alongside patient data stored in CSV files. The system aims to assist radiologists in identifying potential cases of breast cancer, thereby enhancing early diagnosis and treatment planning.
